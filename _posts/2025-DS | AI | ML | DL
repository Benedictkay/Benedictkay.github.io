# 🌱 A Journey into Data Science, ML, AI, and DL

Hi, I’m **Kaleli Benedict**, and this marks the beginning of my journey into the world of **Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning**.  

I’ve always been curious about how data shapes decisions and how intelligent systems can learn, adapt, and solve problems on their own. This curiosity led me to explore the tools and concepts behind today’s most powerful technologies.  

Over time, I’ve been learning how to:
- 📊 Analyze and visualize data to find meaning and patterns  
- 🤖 Build and train machine learning models using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow**  
- 🧠 Understand deep learning and neural networks in real-world contexts  
- ⚙️ Apply ethical thinking and fairness in AI development  
- 🚀 Keep improving through hands-on projects and collaboration  

My goal is simple — **to keep learning, experimenting, and sharing** what I discover along the way. This space will document my growth, insights, and lessons learned as I explore the endless possibilities in tech.  

If you’re also passionate about AI or just starting out, I’d love to connect, learn, and grow together.
